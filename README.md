# Unity_TeachingUofC_2020

### In Unity:

4 different scenes for the 4 different days we met.

### Max:

Various patches we worked on...

## "GAME":

In *Unity*, open **Scene 4**.
In *Max*, open **MAIN_patch** (make sure there are no error messages...)

Start the game in *Unity*. The sound in *Max* should start automatically. Various actions in Unity will affect the sound:

1. distance to objects will affect "wind" (noise)
2. walking through various arches will affect the volume of the bass or melody
3. jumping will change the bass/melody

This isn't perfect but it kinda works! Have fun!!


Here is the link to the Zoom recordings of the seminar.
